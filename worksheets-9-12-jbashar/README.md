# Worksheets 9-12

In this repository you can find the .md file with worksheets 9-12, and the sequence tutorial and data files for worksheet 10.

On Thursday 10/27 in class we will convert worksheet-10's tutorial from .R (plain R script) to .Rmd (R markdown), merge it into the file for worksheets 9-12, save it as .Rmd, and finally upload/commit it to GitHub to turn it in.

**Remember** to enclose blocks of code triple backticks, such as:

```
some lines of code
in this code block
```

You can look at the raw (unformatted) text of this README.md file to see how the formatting is encoded.

**Also**, remember to use double spaces at the end of a line to get a new line *if* you're not already adding an empty line in between.

...**AND** an empty line in between is ***often*** required in markdown to get the formatting to work, e.g. an empty line is needed before a list or a code block for them to be properly formatted.
