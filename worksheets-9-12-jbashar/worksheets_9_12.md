#Worksheet 9: Work in a group to make a poster **Note**: programming is often done by one person in silence, but a lot of research shows that we learn better when we talk about what we are learning. That's why we do a group activity today. 1. Pick a random letter between A and D using the `sample()` function. (*hint 1*: first make a vector with the letters A, B, C and D, then pass that vector to `sample()`; *hint 2*: sample() takes two arguments. The first is a vector and the second is the size of the sample you want, in this case 1)   ```vector <- c("A","B","C","D")sample(vector,1)```

2. Your random letter determines what is your topic for today:
	* A. Functions in R
	* B. Datatypes in R
	* C. Plots in R
	* D. For loops in R


#####There are two types of loops in R: "For each" & "while"    ##### For each is used to specify functions that should be performed on each item of a list, array, ##### While loops: repeats workflow of code as long as some condition holds true; when it is no longer true condition then the loop will end and move to next flow statment

#Worksheet 11 Do a Swirl tutorial in Rstudio1. Open Rstudio, install the swirl package using the `install.packages()` function and then load the swirl package using the `library()` command. 2. Open swirl by typing `swirl()`. When swirl asks you what course you want to do, **choose 1: R Programming**. 
	*	Then there will be the choice between 15 different tutorials. Pick one that looks useful to you. I would not start with the apply functions, but any other tutorial is fine.3. Make notes here about the most important things you learn in the tutorial you chose: Awesome! I hope you like swirl and come back to it later!Name: Date:

#Worksheet 12: Do codeschool TryR chapter 61. Why do you think is it more practical to have data in a data.frame then in individual vectors? 2. You've learned three ways to extract a column from a data.frame. Which are they? 3. The `read.table()` and `read.csv()` functions are extremely useful. Which are the different arguments for these functions used in the tutorial?***Great. Almost done with all the codeschool stuff!***Name: Date:
